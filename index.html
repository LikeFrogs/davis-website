                    <h1>Davis Snider</h1>
                    <p>
							My passion for game development has been a driving force throughout my life -  from an early age when I used
						to create my own board games from the other games we had around the house, to my first efforts at video game
						design in middle and high school, to my enrollment at Rochester Institute of Technology where I am
						currently pursuing a degree in Game Design and Development. 
						<br/><br/>
							Whether in an engine like Unity or Unreal Engine where I work on video game projects with a team of other RIT 
						students or on pen and paper as I design and balance my own tabletop rpg systems, you can almost always 
						find me working on my latest design challenge. I’m versed in a wide variety of programming and scripting 
						languages from C++ and C# to visual scripting with Blueprints in Unreal. I’ve always had a deep, intuitive
						sense of what makes games fun and that sense is what drives me to create, striving to design the best 
						possible experience. It has always been my dream to be a video game designer and I am eager to take the 
						next steps in my professional development.
						<br/><br/>
							I’m actively seeking internships in the games industry and am always interested in new and exciting
						opportunities. You can see some samples of my work on my <a href=" https://github.com/LikeFrogs ">github</a>.
						Feel free to reach out to me at dls7470@rit.edu or (540)750-1740.

					<h2>Phantom Frame (Working Title)</h2>
					<h3>
						First-Person Survival Horror Game
					</h3>

					<p>
						Phantom Frame is a first-person survival horror game in which the player uses an enchanted polaroid camera to photograph otherwise invisible monsters. 

						The game takes place in a noir-inspired setting in which our hero, a freelance detective, finds herself down on her luck, until she stumbles across a puzzling case, 
						and a strange polaroid camera that can photograph the unseen. Dead-set on following this thread of crime, she pursues dangerous beings which can only be seen with this strange camera,
						and slowly unravels the mystery behind the string of strange supernatural stuff that's going on in town.
							
						<ul>
							My contributions:
							<li>Created the AI behaviors for the monsters</li>
							<li>Wrote general narrative and demo level scenario</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Gungi/War Council</h2>
					<h3>
						Abstract Strategy Game in Three Dimensions
					</h3>
					<p>
						This is a short-term project I started over the summer as a chance to work on something a little
						different, with the hopes of publishing on mobile sometime soon. The game is similar to chess and 
						shogi (Japanese chess), but with the ability to stack pieces on top of each other. It is 
						based on a game appearing in the popular anime Hunter X Hunter with rules developed on Reddit 
						that I modified slightly  after playtesting. This is also a solo project with all
						art and programming by me. The game is nearly done, so expect to see a build go live soon!
						The coolest features I've implemented are:
						<ul>
									<li>An event-based system for moving pieces on your turn</li>
									<li>Calculating all legal moves for the current player (and thus determining if they are in checkmate)</li>
								</ul>

					<h2>Project Rose Garden</h2>
					<h3>
						Turn-based Stealth Strategy Game
					</h3>
					<p>

						Project Rose Garden was a somewhat longer term project that I used primarily as a way to learn Unity 3D.
						Rather than use plugins or pre-writen algorithms, I implemented all the features myself. I tackled many challenges while working
						on this project and learned a lot! I have since moved on to other projects, but working on this game was invaluable in developing my
						skills early in my career.
						<ul>
							The most important features I worked on are the following:
      							<li>A custom variant of A* enemy pathfinding</li>
      							<li>A dynamic UI dialogue system</li>
      							<li>Combat, patrol and search behaviors for NPCs</li>
      						</ul>

					<h2>Stealth Cooking</h2>
					<h3>
						2D Stealth Game
					</h3>
					<p>
						This was a group project created for Ludum Dare 41. Our theme was "Combine Two 
						Incompatible Genres" and after some deliberation we settled on stealh and cooking. In this game 
						the player takes control of a hungry teen who gets up in the middle of the night and must make 
						pizza without waking the house.	Click the image to play the game on Itch!
						<ul>
							The cool things I did are:
							<li>Implemented the inventory and crafting systems</li>
							<li>Directed the development of the class hierarchy for the project</li>

					<h2>Custodi-MAN</h2>
					<h3>
						Turn-based Puzzle Game
					</h3>
					<p>
						This was my first game project here at RIT. A group of friends and I developed this game for a 
						charity event on campus called Hero Jam. Our theme was "Everyday Heroes" and so our game was 
						about the heroic exploits of a janitor. Click the image to play the game on Itch!
						<ul>
							My contributions to the project were:
							<li>All programming for the player controller</li>
							<li>The resource management system</li>
							<li>UI programming for the title screen and "Mission Accomplished" screens</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Entangled</h2>
					<h3>
						3D Puzzle-Platformer
					</h3>
					<p>
						This very short-term team project was basically a tech demothat we put together to test our skills.
						The game's core mechanic is the player's ability to control two 
						instances of himself that can both interact with different parts of the world, but not each other. 
						The code is available on github.
						<ul>
							The features I've worked on were:
							<li>The handling of the two instance system: death and respawning of one or both characters</li>
							<li>Moveable blocks for planned block puzzles</li>
						</ul>
