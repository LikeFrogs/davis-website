					<h2>Project Rose Garden</h2>
					<p>
						Turn-based Stealth Strategy Game
					</p>
					<p>
						Project Rose Garden is my (as yet unnamed) primary personal project. I'm the sole developer on the game and have
						implemented all the features myself. I've learned a lot of cool stuff working on this project! The most important features
						I've worked on are the following:
						<ul>
      							<li>A custom variant of A* enemy pathfinding</li>
      							<li>A dynamic UI dialogue system</li>
      							<li>Combat, patrol and search behaviors for NPCs</li>
      						</ul>

					<h2>Gungi/War Council</h2>
					<p>
						Abstract Strategy Game in Three Dimensions
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a short-term project I started on over the summer as a chance to work on something a little different, with the hopes of publishing on mobile sometime soon.
						The game is similar to chess and shogi (Japanese chess), but with the ability to stack pieces on top of each other. The game is based on a game appearing in the popular
						anime Hunter X Hunter with rules developed on Reddit that I then made a few modifications to after playtesting. This is also a solo project with all art and programming by me.
						THe coolest features I've implemented are:
						<ul>
      							<li>An event-based system for moving pieces on your turn</li>
      							<li>Calculating all legal moves for the current player (and thus determining if they are in checkmate)</li>
      							<li>???</li>
      						</ul>

					<h2>Custodi-MAN</h2>
					<p>
						Turn-based Puzzle Game
					</p>
					<p>
						This was my first game project here at RIT. A group of friends and I developed this game for a charity event on campus called Hero Jam.
						Our theme was "Everyday Heroes" and so our game was about the heroic expoits of a janitor. My contributions to the project were:
						<ul>
      							<li>All programming for the player controller</li>
      							<li>The resource management system</li>
      							<li>UI programming for the title screen and "Mission Accomplished" screens</li>
      						</ul>

					<h2>Stealth Cooking</h2>
					<p>
						2D Stealth Game
					</p>
					<p>
						Another group project, this game was created for Ludum Dare 41. Our theme was "Combine 2 Incompatible Genres" and after some deliberation we settled on stealh and cooking.
						In this game the player takes control of a hungry teen who gets up in the middle of the night and must make pizza without waking the house.
						The cool things I did are:
						<ul>
      							<li>Implemented the inventory and crafting systems</li>
      							<li>Directed the development of the class hierarchy for the project</li>
      						</ul>

					<h2>Project Quantum</h2>
					<p>
						3D Puzzle Platformer
					</p>
					<p>
						This is my most recent project (started just a couple weeks ago!) and is my first game made with a team of more than four people. The game's core mechanics
						is the player's ability to control two instances of himself that can both interact with different parts of the world, but not each other. The features I've worked on so far are:
						<ul>
      							<li>The handling of the two instance system: death and respawning of one or both characters</li>
      							<li>Moveable blocks for planned block puzzles</li>
      						</ul>
