                    <h1>Davis Snider</h1>
                    <p>
		    	My passion for game development has been a driving force throughout my life -  from an early age when I used
		    to create my own board games from the other games we had around the house, to my first efforts at video game
		    design in middle and high school, to my eventual enrollment at Rochester Institute of Technology where I am
		    currently pursuing a degree in Game Design and Development. 
		    <br/><br/>
			    Whether in an engine like Unity or Unreal Engine where I work on video game projects with a team of other RIT 
		    students or on pen and paper as I design and balance my own tabletop rpg systems, you can almost always 
		    find me working on my latest design challenge. I’m versed in a wide variety of programming and scripting 
		    languages from C++ and C# to visual scripting with Blueprints in Unreal. I’ve always had a deep, intuitive
		    sense of what makes games fun and that sense is what drives me to create, striving to design the best 
		    possible experience. It has always been my dream to be a video game designer and I am eager to take the 
		    next steps in my professional development.
			    <br/><br/>
                        I’m actively seeking internships in the games industry and am always interested in new and exciting
                        opportunities. You can see some samples of my work on my <a href=" https://github.com/LikeFrogs ">github</a>.
                        I’ll be attending GDC as a CA this year and would love to meet with you in person if you also plan to be there! 
                        Feel free to reach out to me at dls7470@rit.edu or (540)750-1740.

					<h2>Project Rose Garden</h2>
					<p>
						Turn-based Stealth Strategy Game
					</p>
					<p>
						Project Rose Garden is my (as yet unnamed) primary personal project. I'm the sole developer on 
						the game and have implemented all the features myself. I've tackled many challenges while working
						on this project and learned a lot! The game is still in development so I don't have a non-debug build yet, but my 
						code is available on github. The most important features I've worked on are the following:
						<ul>
      							<li>A custom variant of A* enemy pathfinding</li>
      							<li>A dynamic UI dialogue system</li>
      							<li>Combat, patrol and search behaviors for NPCs</li>
      						</ul>

					<h2>Gungi/War Council</h2>
					<p>
						Abstract Strategy Game in Three Dimensions
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a short-term project I started on over the summer as a chance to work on something a little
						different, with the hopes of publishing on mobile sometime soon. The game is similar to chess and 
						shogi (Japanese chess), but with the ability to stack pieces on top of each other. It is 
						based on a game appearing in the popular anime Hunter X Hunter with rules developed on Reddit 
						that I modified slightly  after playtesting. This is also a solo project with all
						art and programming by me. The game is nearly done, so expect to see a build go live soon!
						The coolest features I've implemented are:
						<ul>
      							<li>An event-based system for moving pieces on your turn</li>
      							<li>Calculating all legal moves for the current player (and thus determining if they are in checkmate)</li>
      						</ul>

					<h2>Custodi-MAN</h2>
					<p>
						Turn-based Puzzle Game
					</p>
					<p>
						This was my first game project here at RIT. A group of friends and I developed this game for a 
						charity event on campus called Hero Jam. Our theme was "Everyday Heroes" and so our game was 
						about the heroic exploits of a janitor. Click the image to play the game on Itch!
						My contributions to the project were:
						<ul>
      							<li>All programming for the player controller</li>
      							<li>The resource management system</li>
      							<li>UI programming for the title screen and "Mission Accomplished" screens</li>
      						</ul>

					<h2>Stealth Cooking</h2>
					<p>
						2D Stealth Game
					</p>
					<p>
						Another group project, this game was created for Ludum Dare 41. Our theme was "Combine 2 
						Incompatible Genres" and after some deliberation we settled on stealh and cooking. In this game 
						the player takes control of a hungry teen who gets up in the middle of the night and must make 
						pizza without waking the house.	Click the image to play the game on Itch! The cool things I did are:
						<ul>
      							<li>Implemented the inventory and crafting systems</li>
      							<li>Directed the development of the class hierarchy for the project</li>
      						</ul>

					<h2>Entangled</h2>
					<p>
						3D Puzzle-Platformer
					</p>
					<p>
						This is an ongoing team project and my first game made with a
						team of more than four people. The game's core mechanics is the player's ability to control two 
						instances of himself that can both interact with different parts of the world, but not each other. 
						The game is still in development, but we're currently on hiatus as about half of our members are
						working this semester. We plan to resume development over the summer. The code is available
						on github. The features I've worked on so far are:
						<ul>
      							<li>The handling of the two instance system: death and respawning of one or both characters</li>
      							<li>Moveable blocks for planned block puzzles</li>
      						</ul>
